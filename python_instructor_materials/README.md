# Instructor materials

The instructor materials consist of two lectures and two exercise notebooks. The html slides are generated from the jupyter notebooks by executing the notebook (see last cell in each notebook). GitHub cannot not render the html slides, so I have created links to https://raw.githack.com/ to display them (see below). Alternatively, you can also download the files and display them in your own browser.

## Lecture slides
The lectures are used in between topics to introduce concepts and repeat key lessons.

- [Lecture notes Day 2](https://raw.githack.com/mwakok/software_carpentries/main/python_instructor_materials/python_lecture_2.slides.html#/)

## Exercise slides  
The exercise notebook contain answers and are (currently) not designed for self-paced learning. They are designed to be introduced and guided by an exercise leader.
